üëã Hi there! I'm Martin-Louis Bright and I am a software engineer living in Toronto Canada. üë®‚Äçüíª

For the last little while, I have been a [GitHub Enterprise][ghes] site administrator at [Autodesk Inc.][autodesk].

I love [automating things][xkcd-automation] and developing software that helps people and organizations.

My favorite programming language is [Go][golang] but recently, I have started to [learn Rust][rust] and it may take the #1 spot.

I am also proficient in [Python][python], Bash, and [Perl][perl].

I am at home with Linux and MacOS systems, my public cloud of choice is [AWS][aws], and I happily write SQL.

I think infrastructure as code and [gitops][gitops] are great and I embraced [devops culture][devops] even before it had a name.

I have over 20 years of experience in information technology.
