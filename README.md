üëã Hi there! I'm Martin-Louis Bright and I am a software engineer living in Toronto, Canada. üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm currently working at [cPacket Networks][cpacket], where I operate mainly in Azure and AWS, and where I write a lot of Bash, Python, and (increasingly) Typescript.

Prior to that, I was a [GitHub Enterprise][ghes] site administrator at [Autodesk Inc.][autodesk].

I love [automating things][xkcd-automation], configuring services, and developing software that helps people and organizations.

I am proficient in [Python][python], Bash, [Perl][perl], and [Go][golang] programming, but I prefer [Rust][rust] to all of those, even though I'm not as comfortable in it yet.
(Using [Typescript][typescript] means I can maintain my career long pledge to avoid languages prefixed with 'Java'.)

I am at home with Linux (my favorite distro is _still_ Ubuntu) and MacOS systems, my public cloud of choice is [AWS][aws] (but I'm now also a fan of [Azure][azure]), and I happily write SQL.

I think infrastructure as code and [gitops][gitops] are great and I embraced [devops culture][devops] even before it had a name.

I have over [20 years of experience][cv] in information technology.
