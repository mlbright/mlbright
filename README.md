👋 Hi there! I'm Martin-Louis Bright and I am software engineer living in Toronto Canada.  👨‍💻

For the last little while, I have been a GitHub Enterprise site administrator at Autodesk Inc.

I love automating things and developing software that helps people and organizations.

I am proficient in Python, Bash, Perl and Go programming.

My favorite programming language is Go but Recently, I have started to learn Rust and it may take the #1 spot.

I am at home with Linux and Mac OS systems, my public cloud of choice is AWS, and I can write SQL.

I think infrastructure as code is the way to go and I embraced devops culture even before it had a name.

I have over 20 years of experience in information technology.
