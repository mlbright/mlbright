üëã Hi there! I'm Martin-Louis Bright and I am a software engineer living in Toronto, Canada. üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm currently working at [cPacket Networks][cpacket], where I operate mainly in Azure and AWS, and where I write a lot of Bash, Python, and (increasingly) Typescript.

Prior to that, I was a [GitHub Enterprise][ghes] [site administrator][github-site-admin] at [Autodesk][autodesk].

I love [automating things][xkcd-automation], configuring services, and developing software that helps people and organizations.

I am proficient in [Python][python], Bash, [Perl][perl], and [Go][golang] programming, but I prefer [Rust][rust] to all of those, even though I'm not as comfortable in it yet.
(Using [Typescript][typescript] is a sneaky way to maintain my career long pledge to avoid languages prefixed with 'Java'.)

I am at home with Linux (my favorite distro is _still_ Ubuntu) and MacOS systems, my public cloud of choice is [AWS][aws] (but I'm now also a fan of [Azure][azure]), and I happily write SQL.

I think infrastructure as code and [Gitops][gitops] are great and I embraced [devops culture][devops] even before it had a name.

I have over [20 years of experience][cv] in information technology.

Most of the Git repositories here contain experimental or proof-of-concept code that is unmaintained because of lack of time, few or no end users, deprecated APIs, or because my interest has waned.
However, if you have questions about them, send me old fashioned email.
