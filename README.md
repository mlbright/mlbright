üëã Hi there! I'm Martin-Louis Bright and I am a software engineer living in Toronto, Canada. üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm currently working at [cPacket Networks][cpacket], where I operate mainly in Azure and AWS.

Prior to that, I was a [GitHub Enterprise][ghes] [site administrator][github-site-admin] at [Autodesk][autodesk].

I love [automating things][xkcd-automation], configuring services, and developing software that helps people and organizations.

I have shipped [Python][python], [Bash][bash], [Go][golang], and [Perl][perl] code to production.

I have also tinkered with [Rust][rust], [Ruby][ruby], [Typescript][typescript], and [Zig][zig].

My career long pledge to avoid programming languages prefixed with 'Java' has probably limited my opportunities.

I am at home and happy with Linux systems (my favorite distro is [Ubuntu][ubuntu]) and MacOS, my public cloud of choice is [AWS][aws] (but I also like [Azure][azure]).

I happily write SQL.

I think infrastructure as code and [Gitops][gitops] are great and I embraced [devops culture][devops] even before it had a name.

I enthusiastically use tmux, SSH, Tailscale, and Wireshark.

I have over [20 years of experience][cv] in information technology.
