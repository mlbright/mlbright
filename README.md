üëã Hi there! I'm Martin-Louis Bright and I am a software engineer living in Toronto, Canada. üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm currently working at [cPacket Networks][cpacket], where I operate mainly in Azure and AWS, and where I write a lot of Bash, Python, and (increasingly) Typescript.

Prior to that, I was a [GitHub Enterprise][ghes] [site administrator][github-site-admin] at [Autodesk][autodesk].

I love [automating things][xkcd-automation], configuring services, and developing software that helps people and organizations.

I can code in [Python][python], [Bash][bash], [Perl][perl], [Go][golang] and [Rust][rust].
Using [Typescript][typescript] is a sneaky way to maintain my career long pledge to avoid programming languages prefixed with 'Java', but I am a pragmatist so this will likely change.

I am at home with Linux (my favorite distro is _still_ Ubuntu) and MacOS systems, my public cloud of choice is [AWS][aws] (but I'm now also a fan of [Azure][azure]), and I happily write SQL.

I think infrastructure as code and [Gitops][gitops] are great and I embraced [devops culture][devops] even before it had a name.

I have over [20 years of experience][cv] in information technology.

An archived repository in this space means that it has few or no end users, or that it is deprecated.
However, if you have questions about any of them, please ask via old fashioned email.
